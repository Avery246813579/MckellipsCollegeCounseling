I am an independent college counselor based in the Boston area. Having worked in Undergraduate Financial Aid and Undergraduate College Admissions at Princeton University and Harvard University I have a unique perspective on college admissions.  My own education combined with my work experience will ensure that, together, we will help the student matriculate at their best fit college or university.
